title: What {{ site.product.short_name }} is not
id: adm-intro-whatnot
description: >-
	The {{ site.product.short_name }} application is not log analysis software. It can filter
	log messages and select only the ones matching certain criteria. It can
	even convert the messages and restructure them to a predefined format,
	or parse the messages and segment them into different fields. But
	{{ site.product.short_name }} cannot interpret and analyze the meaning behind the messages,
	or recognize patterns in the occurrence of different messages.
