To configure {{ site.product.short_name }}, edit the syslog-ng.conf file with any
regular text editor application.

The location of the configuration file depends on how you installed
{{ site.product.short_name }}. Native packages of a platform (like the ones downloaded
from Linux repositories) typically place the configuration file under
the **/etc/syslog-ng/** directory.
