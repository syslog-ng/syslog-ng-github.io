	This section describes the options of geoip2() parser in {{ site.product.short_name }}.
---

The geoip2 parser has the following options.

{% include doc/admin-guide/options/prefix.md %}

{% include doc/admin-guide/default-prefix.md %}

## database()

*Description:* Path to the GeoIP2 database to use. This works with
absolute and relative paths as well. Note that {{ site.product.short_name }} must have
the required privileges to read this file. Do not modify or delete this
file while {{ site.product.short_name }} is running, it can crash {{ site.product.short_name }}.

Starting with version 3.24, {{ site.product.short_name }} tries to automatically detect
the location of the database. If that is successful, the database()
option is not mandatory.
